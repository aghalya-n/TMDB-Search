# FILM BUFF

In this project, I created a React application and used API calls from The Movie Database in order to display movies. The user can search for movies, which will concurrently appear as the user types, and filter them by Popularity and Rating Ascending and Descending. The user can also view a gallery of movies and filter by movie genre. If clicked, the movie will expand and give details such as runtime, summary, etc.
